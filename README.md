# GSUP-File-Downloader
A personal file downloader for the website [REDACTED]. I might unredact the website name someday for public use. This Python script automates the process of downloading files from a specific user page on a website. It utilizes Selenium for web automation, BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML, and various translation libraries to handle non-English titles.

## Features

- Automatically logs into a user account.
- Downloads various file types (HTML, PDF, images, archives).
- Creates a structured directory for downloaded files.
- Translates non-English titles to English.
- Cleans up temporary directories after execution.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Chrome WebDriver (make sure it's in your PATH)
